# LDA
This file aims to show the code which deals with the homework of the lecture Pattern Recognition
# IrisLDA+KNN.py
This code uses LDA and KNN to classify the Iris data, the original IDE I use is Jupyter Notebook, you may feel uncomfortable to read that kind of file so I convert it into Python
# Sonar.py
This code only uses the LDA to classify the Sonar data
